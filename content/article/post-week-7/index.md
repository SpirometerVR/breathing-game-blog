This week, in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic rapidly spreading across the world, USC required all courses to be switched to online until mid April. To adjust to this change our midterm presentation for class was switched to a walkthrough video showing the current state of our VR breathing mini games.


The change in course instruction format to online, plus the recent closure of the campus buildings to help mitigate the spread of the virus, will affect some teams more than others. Our team is optimistic and fully capable to continue our development remotely.


The CHLA team hopes you enjoy our midterm video and wish good health, happiness and love to all during these trying times in the world.
