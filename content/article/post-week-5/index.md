This week the process of prototyping our new mini games is in full swing. After speaking with Professor Marientina & Dr. Vangelis our mini games have pivoted a bit to the following:

name    | description | inhale | exhale
--------|------|-------|---------
Treasure Hunter | You're the wind | slow down | accelerate 
Fruit Fall | Knock fruit down from the trees | collect a pebble | blow pebble at fruit
Save the Village | Be the enemy or the savior | collect air/water | spray fire/water

**Building the scene**

We found amazing low poly environments and items in the unity asset store to help us rapid prototype the new game scenes. Our team primarily works on building and testing the initial game scenes with keyboard input for now.

**Next week...**

Once the scenes are at a decent state we will look into integrating our most important feature, the Digital Spirometer, via the [__Unity Open Sound Control__](https://thomasfredericks.github.io/UnityOSC/) script. Stay tuned!
