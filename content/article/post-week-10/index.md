This week is still focused on polishing our mini-games. During our progress review with Professor Vangelis it was recommended that we not increase the scope more by adding the Void mini-game. Therefore, with the remaining weeks in this semester the team will do our best to focus on increasing the fidelity of games.

Also, based on the professor's response to our current state of Treasure Hunter we have stepped back to see if another game environment would work better. The problem we needed to solve was issues caused by procedurally generating the river which the player travelled down. It was not as visually pleasing in VR. After a bit of search, we first came upon an underwater scene which looked great, but after testing it out in the Oculus headset we found it had a similar issue as the river scene.

In the end we found the following space scene which provided the best results for what we were attempting to solve.

**Next up...**

We will continue to polish and combine the two mini-games one Unity project with a shared start menu.
