This week we have been iterating on the polishing of our two mini games, Treasure Hunter and Fruit Fall, based on instructor feedback. Minor camera changes were added to improve the visual feedback as the player propels the boat forward in Treasure Hunter. In Fruit Fall a new fruit targeting feature was added to make it easy for players to see which fruit they were aiming at. 

We created a quick proof of concept for our third mini game, The Void, which we would like to add to round off our breathing game selections. The idea for The Void is to have a relaxing, zen like experience in which the player does not need to focus on scorekeeping and leaderboards. We wanted something similar to the Relax feature on Fitbit where you are being calmly instructed on controlling your breathing and slowing your heart rate. In Void you begin in empty space. Exhaling slowly breathes color into a hidden scene. Inhaling slowly drains color out of the scene. Each time you inhale + exhale a new scene is revealed as a calm voice and music instructs you. It's a ROUGH proof >,< ...

We will continue to iterate and polish these games over the remainder of the semester and continue to seek feedback from Dr. Vangelis along the way. See you next week.
